# Icons

Codex contains a collection of {{ numberOfIcons }} icons that can be used to convey actions
or other information visually. See [all icons](./all-icons.md) a full list of available icons per
directionality and language.

## How to use icons

Icons can be imported from the `@wikimedia/codex-icons` package individually, like this:
```typescript
import { cdxIconAlert } from '@wikimedia/codex-icons';
```

Icons can be used through the [icon component](../components/icon.md) or through other components
that accept icons as props. You can also embed the icon component in another component's slot;
for example, you can use the icon component inside the button component to create a button with
an icon. For complete code examples of how to use icons, see the [demos](../components/icon.md#demos)
in the icon component documentation.

### Icon labels
When an icon appears without immediately adjacent text that makes it clear what the icon means,
you should provide an *icon label*. The icon label is used by screen readers and other accessibility
tools as replacement text for the icon. Most browsers also display it as a tooltip when the user
hovers over the icon. If no icon label is set, the icon is hidden from screen readers using the
`aria-hidden` attribute.

Note that **the icon label is invisible**, it's not rendered as visible text next to the icon.
To render an icon followed by text, put the text outside of the icon component, like in the second
example below.

You **should** provide an icon label when there is no other text explaining what the icon means.
For example:
```vue
<cdx-button action="destructive">
	<cdx-icon :icon="cdxIconTrash" icon-label="delete" />
</cdx-button>
```
The code above displays <cdx-button action="destructive">
<cdx-icon :icon="cdxIconTrash" icon-label="delete" />
</cdx-button>, which is read by screen readers as `delete`.


You **should not** provide an icon label when there is other text explaining the same thing that
the icon does, and the icon text would be duplicative. For example:
```vue
<cdx-button action="destructive">
	<cdx-icon :icon="cdxIconTrash" /> Delete this file
</cdx-button>
```
The code above displays <cdx-button action="destructive">
	<cdx-icon :icon="cdxIconTrash" /> Delete this file
</cdx-button>. Screen readers skip over the icon and just read `Delete this file`, which still
makes it clear what the button does. If you added `icon-label="delete"` here, a screen reader would
read `delete Delete this file`, which is not a good experience for screen reader users.

## Icon colors
All icons are *monochrome*, meaning the entire icon is the same color. By default, icons use the
base text color (`{{ tokens.color.base.value }}`), but this can be overridden by changing the
`color` property of the `.cdx-icon` element in CSS. For example:
```css
.my-important-component .cdx-icon {
	color: #36c;
}
```
Some components, like [CdxButton](../components/button.md) style their icons to match the
surrounding text color, so that e.g. destructive buttons have red icons to match the red text.

## Right-to-left (RTL) and language support
Many icons have different versions for left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL) contexts.
For example, `cdxIconJournal` looks like <cdx-icon :icon="cdxIconJournal" dir="ltr" /> in
LTR, but looks like <cdx-icon :icon="cdxIconJournal" dir="rtl" /> in RTL. The icon component
automatically detects the direction of its environment, and chooses the correct icon accordingly.
For example, if `<cdx-icon :icon="cdxIconJournal" />` appears on a page that is RTL, or inside of
a `<div dir="rtl">` tag, the RTL version of the icon will be displayed.

Similarly, some icons have different versions for different languages. For example, `cdxIconBold`
looks like <cdx-icon :icon="cdxIconBold" lang="en" /> in English, but looks like
<cdx-icon :icon="cdxIconBold" lang="fr" /> in French. The icon component also automatically detects
the language of its environment, so if for example `<cdx-icon :icon="cdxIconBold" />` appears on a
page that has `<html lang="fr">` at the root, or inside of a `<p lang="fr">`, the French version
of the icon will be displayed.

### Limitations and override
The automatic direction and language detection feature has limitations. It only detects the
direction and language of the surrounding context when the icon component is initially mounted.
If the surrounding context changes later, for example because the `lang` or `dir` attribute on the
parent/ancestor is changed, the icon will not notice these changes and will not update to reflect
them.

If you run into this limitation, or if the automatic direction/language detection isn't working
for other reasons, you can set the direction and/or language explicitly through the `dir` and
`lang` props:
```vue
Bold icon in German: <cdx-icon :icon="cdxIconBold" lang="de" />
Journal icon in RTL: <cdx-icon :icon="cdxIconJournal" dir="rtl" />
```
